# 120 Cameras

## Compact Style

### Baldixette
- Pop-out front lens
- Lens release feels a bit stiff
- Shutter is tempermental
- Could all do with a good oil but an iteresting thing
- Comes with hard case and originl paper manual

### Ilford Envoy
- x-ref 620.md
- Super cool art-deco styling
- Push in/Pull out lens
- Version 1 or 2 (pre-1960)
- Shutter seems to fire fine
- An attractive thing

## Pseudo-TLR
### <s>Voigtländer Brilliant (1)
- Everything moves freely
- Presumably a later model - more shutter speeds
- Shutter sticks a little at 1/10 or slower
- Viewfinder lens is filthy - will benefit from a good clean
- Rear clasps are 1x missing and 1x bet but still closes firmly and seems light tight
- Should shoot nicely after a good clean
- Leather branded case</s>

### <s>Voigtländer Brilliant (2)
- Everything moves freely
- Fewer shutter speeds
- Better than the previous one but still could do with a clean
- Leather case
- Advance feels like there's a mystery film in there so no opened!</s>

## TLR

### Lubitel 2
- A bit dusty outside but inside seems very clean
- Fires well
- Adjusters turn
- Has "linked" lenses so focussing the viewing lens focusses the taking lens
- f/4.5 75mm
- Two piece leather case and strap

## Box

### Zeiss Ikon Tengor (54/14?)
- Label states "Zeiss Ikon Film 6 1/2 x 11cm, D, 2 1/2 x 4 1/4 in"
- Seems to cock and fire well
- Assuming 120 film *but* they did make this in other sizes and there is nothing else indicative.
- Leatherette has come away a tiny bit on the back but otherwise good condition for something ~90 years old. Should shoot!

### Braun Imperial
- All lenses need a good clean
- Two speeds (M and Z - instant and time)
- Two apertures - Light and Dark
- Shutter fires

- Leather case with some minor damage
